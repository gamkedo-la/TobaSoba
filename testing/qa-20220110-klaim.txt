Level 1
-------

1. An introduction or at least title screen would have been nice, but I suppose it will come later :)

2. Jumping on the first blocks, the character is super close to the bottom of the camera,
    which means that I cannot see what's below - I can't see the ground (screenshot 1), which makes the platforming more difficult,
    (see level design issues with "leap of faith" in old platformers).

3. I died in the spikes, the screen becomes white-ish and asks to press R to retry.
    I press R but I get the main menu instead of retrying. I expected to immediately retry.
    I now have to select the level to get back to the beginning of the level.

4. I failed to jump and falled over an enemy (the purple rolling ones) and it killed it.
    It was not clear to me at all that it was possible to kill them by jumping on them.

5. Is it normal that I am ejected into the air each time I restart level 0? I think not, the velocity varies each time. Is this a velocity not cleared before resetting?

6. Colliding with the green and orange things that looks like locks will not always take them. I often had to pass forth and back to get them.

7. While flying in the air I once did a jump, so it made me feel like there was a double jump, but there is none.

8. The second block of the spike area in the beginning of the level is pretty hard to get right.
    I think this one is too early in the game and can act as a barrier for the player.

9. The controls feel like I should have a bit more control, in particular because of the initial impulse, even if we only pressed quickly to jump, which is too big.
    I think it would work better with a less strong initial pulse but more control of that pulse in the jump buttons.

10. I got stuck in the top left angle of the 2nd block over the spikes in the beginning. Had to jump to get free but died. That physics/collision bug felt unfair.
    Just got stuck again but this time with the corner of the first block column.

11. I only realized after several minutes, when reading the menu, that the game does have music, but does not play it at first (becuase gamedev mode?)
    Also beware: the music is pretty loud by default.

12. Pressing X in the menu to turn the music on/off will change as long as the key is down instead of once when it's down. So it's being on/off in loop and it's pretty hard to release at the right choice. (actually I'll try to fix that - done)

13. The music is pretty weird and feels like it's voluntarilly "broken". Is that intended or is it just that the music need work? In any way it gives a creepy atmosphere, which is interesting but just pointing it in case it was not intended.

14. I falled into the spikes and it was not a death. Until I started moving. (collision issue)

15. After about 50 attempts I couldnt pass the first spikes, so for the purpose of continuing testing I added some blocks over the spikes to be able to skip them.

16. Note that I have no idea what the thing we collect are and what's their use.

17. The chanmges to the level are not kept between plays so I have to re-edit the level each time for passing the spikes and I hav to do it first because editing will also reset the level.

18. A way to roll faster toward the sides would be nice, it's too slow otherwise. Also if that faster roll (maybe holding a key?) would also allow a more long jump (more horizontal) that would help a lot too.

19. The fantoms are a nice chang, but they also don't look like they do anything dangerous.

20. Scratch that, I got killed by a fantom XD

21. I jumped on the black blocks but got through them twice, so I don't know if they are supposed to help getting on the higher level or not.
    They are also not coming back so I don't know what to do.

22. I'm starting to wonder if the game isn't running super slow? Because all the movements seems slow to me.

23. I'm stopping here because I retried several times and can't get up.


Level 2
-------

1. FIXEd - I cannot seem myself at first, just the rectamgle of th emap goes down for a long (infinite?) time.

2. I see 2 player characters at the beginning, one I control, 1 fix (screenshot-2).

3. There is a cloud with arrows on it but it does not move (screenshot-2).

4. What's the mustache face doing here? (screenshot-3) I can't interract with it XD

5. Black boxes can't be used as platform again. :/

6. Water does not seem to do anything?

7. I got through the last quarter of teh elvel without much problem because I was just rolling on water all the way and then started to climb the stairs.
    I didn't meet any ennemies or anything that moves. It feels like smoe things should be moving but arent?

8. The "leap of faith" jump there is a bit problematic (screenshot-4).

9. I don't know what's that orange ball, I though it was the exit but it does nothing when I reach it. (screenshot-5)

10. I can't go up from there (screenshot-5) so I will stop here.
